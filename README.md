# sqlpp23

sqlpp23 is a type safe embedded domain specific language for SQL queries and results in C++.
It allows you to write SQL in the form of C++ expressions:

  * Tables, columns, result fields are represented as structs or data members
  * Statements and clauses are constructed by functions
  * Your IDE can help you write SQL in C++
  * Your compiler will find a lot of typical mistakes long before they hit integration tests or even production, e.g.
    * typos
    * comparing apples to oranges
    * a missing table in `from()`
    * missing a non-default column in `insert_into()`
    * selecting a mix of aggregates and non-aggregates
    * differences in SQL dialects from one database backend to the next, see below

sqlpp23â€™s core is vendor-neutral.

Specific traits of databases (e.g. unsupported or non-standard features) are handled by connector libraries.
Connector libraries can inform you and your IDE of missing features at compile time.
They also interpret expressions specifically where needed.
For example, the connector could use the `operator||` or the `concat` method for string concatenation without your being required to change the statement.

Connectors for MariaDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, sqlite3, sqlcipher are included in this repository.

Documentation is found in [docs](/docs/README.md).

## Examples:

Let's assume we have a database connection object `db` and a table object `foo` representing something like

```SQL
CREATE TABLE foo (
    id bigint NOT NULL,
    name varchar(50),
    hasFun bool NOT NULL
);
```

[insert](/docs/insert.md)
```C++
db(insert_into(foo).set(foo.id = 17, foo.name = "bar", foo.hasFun = true));
```

[update](/docs/update.md)
```C++
db(update(foo).set(foo.name = std::nullopt).where(foo.name != "nobody"));
```

[delete](/docs/delete.md)
```C++
db(delete_from(foo).where(not foo.hasFun));
```

[select](/docs/select.md)
```C++
// selecting zero or more results, iterating over the results
for (const auto& row : db(select(foo.id, foo.name, foo.hasFun)
                          .from(foo)
                          .where(foo.id > 17 and foo.name.like("%bar%"))))
{
  std::cout << row.id << '\n';                    // int64_t
  std::cout << row.name.value_or("NULL") << '\n'; // std::optional<std::string_view>
  std::cout << row.hasFun() << '\n';              // bool
}
```

[database specific](/docs/connectors.md)
```C++
  for (const auto &row : db(sql::insert_into(foo)
                                .set(foo.id = 7, foo.name = std::nullopt, foo.hasFun = false)
                                .on_conflict(foo.id)
                                .do_update(foo.name = "updated")
                                .where(foo.id > 17)
                                .returning(foo.name))) {
    std::cout << row.name.value_or("NULL") << '\n';
  }
```
